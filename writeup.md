# Executive Summary

# Business Context
Anhauser-Bush InBev is a leading multinational beverage and brewing company with roughly 25 percent market share world wide. Their portfolio ranged from global brands, including Budweiser and Corona, to local brands, such as Harbin and Jupiler. Currently, they are looking to expand their presence in the US market with their Dutch premium beer, Hertog Jan, and they need to validate that this is good decision. If they decide to enter the market, ABInBev still has to determine how they want to position Hertog Jan in the market. Their goal is to maximize adoption of the brand Hertog Jan in the new market.

# Test Market

Test cannibalization in a test market of Beck's and Stella. Use a controlled test market.

# Recommendations

## Limitations:

Maybe we want to design a product that doesn't cannibalize our own strongly. We want to maximize our profit across our entire product portfolio.

# Conclusions

# Guidelines
Pay attention to:
1) how extraneous errors are controlled for,
2) if and how randomization is implemented,
3) how you measure various dependent, independent, and control variables, and
4) the statistical designs proposed and it’s efficiency.

Management is concerned with a number of issues:
1) The validity of the measurements and experimental design (both internal and external),
representativeness, and reliability of the results.
2) That all relevant extraneous factors and customer characteristics are controlled for.
3) InBev would like to get a sense of the extent that Hertog Jan cannibalizes its other major brands
in the US: Becks and Stella Artois.
